1. first time run at ubuntu causes: X Error: BadAccess (attempt to access private resource denied) 10
  - use env var and run it (e.g., sudo QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 /usr/local/ampps/Ampps)
  - ref: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1063000/ampps-first-run-errors-control-panel-blank

2. apache does not start when running ampps: 
  - another web server might be running and dominate port 80 so stop it.

  - if appach still not starting after try above, you need to install other dependencies. try below:
  `
    sudo cd /usr/local/ampps/apache/lib

    sudo mkdir bck

    sudo mv ./libapr* ./bck/

    sudo apt-get -y install libaprutil1 libaprutil1-dev libapr1 libapr1-dev
